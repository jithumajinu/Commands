You can also rename the general query log file at runtime by disabling the log:

=> SET GLOBAL general_log = 'OFF';
With the log disabled, rename the log file externally (for example, from the command line). Then enable the log again:

=> SET GLOBAL general_log = 'ON';


/usr/local/mysql/data/jithupm-PC-177.log  change mode to read only.

Terminal monitoring ->
tail -f  /usr/local/mysql/data/jithupm-PC-177.log

OR
